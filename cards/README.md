# v4 practice task cards: v4-practice-alpha, -beta, -gamma, -delta (facts only)

**Status: practice cards (Practice α, β, γ, δ).** These are debugging cards for participants,
not the hackathon cards A–D (`v4-a`..`v4-d`) or the hidden cards E–H. The organizers generate
the practice cards from secret seeds; the generator inputs are not in this repository. Once
registered, a practice card's full file set (`config/`, `public/`, `truth/`) is downloadable from
the Resources page, so participants score their agents locally with the same weather as the
platform.

## Layout

```
cards/
  v4-practice-alpha/card.json    facts of card α, read from its registered bundle
  v4-practice-beta/card.json     same for β
  v4-practice-gamma/card.json    same for γ
  v4-practice-delta/card.json    same for δ
```

`card.json` holds what a card page states (site, season, nights, targets, required targets,
regions, sky area, fibres, exposure range, score zero points, wall clock, stress) and the
manifest checksum of the bundle (`public.scenarios.checksum`). No seed and no hidden value.
`scripts/build-v4-practice-cards.py --facts BUNDLE --card <slug>` writes it from a built bundle,
`--pages` renders `web/src/content/taskcard.<alpha|beta|gamma|delta>.v4.<en|zh>.md` from it
(tests/test_v4_practice_cards.py fails if a page and its `card.json` disagree).

## Card parameters

| | v4-practice-alpha (α) | v4-practice-beta (β) | v4-practice-gamma (γ) | v4-practice-delta (δ) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| site | Paranal -24.62 deg | same | same | same |
| footprint | 3 regions / 2000 deg2 | 3 / 1920 deg2 | 3 / 1980 deg2 | 3 / 1880 deg2 |
| targets (required) | 10000 (500) | 9600 (480) | 9900 (495) | 9400 (564) |
| nights | 2026-10-04 -> 2026-11-10 (38) | 2026-10-18 -> 2026-11-24 (38) | 2026-10-09 -> 2026-11-15 (38) | 2026-10-24 -> 2026-11-30 (38) |
| fibres / area | 16 (4x4) / 0.4 deg2 | same | same | same |
| stress | no | no | yes (data loss) | yes (data loss) |

## Registering them as practice cards

Per card: a `public.scenarios` row with the card's slug (contract `v4-score-v1`,
`global_wallclock_seconds` 900, weather, forecasts and events public), the bundle ZIP as its
evaluation bundle, `config/`, `public/` and `truth/` in the `scenarios` bucket under the slug, the
card parked in a sealed staging phase until it is linked to `practice-projects` and its files are
listed in `private.observer_scenario_public_files` (release `practice`). Do not use the slugs
`v4-a`..`v4-h`: they are the hackathon and hidden cards.

**Do not use the admin "rotate seed" action on a v4 card.** It runs
`worker/main.py:process_scenario_job`, which is v3-only and has no contract guard: it would
overwrite `scenarios/<slug>/` with a v3 scenario and flip the row's contract, while the private
v4 bundle stays untouched.
