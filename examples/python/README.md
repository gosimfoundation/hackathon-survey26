# python-agent -- an example agent for participant-agent-protocol-v4

[中文说明见 README.zh.md](README.zh.md)

A small, Codex-style reference implementation for the GOSIM survey26 hackathon's
telescope-survey challenge. It speaks `participant-agent-protocol-v4` (one JSON object
per line on stdin/stdout) and is organized as a real multi-module project instead of a
single script, so you can see where each concern lives and lift whichever part you need.

It runs a real anchor-search planner (rank candidates, try each fibre as the pointing
centre, fill the other 15 with the best-value neighbours, size the exposure and pick a
program by expected rate) -- the same algorithm as this repo's companion TypeScript
example, so the two are directly comparable -- plus two LLM-advised planning calls
each night. Needs an API key to run; see Configuration below. Read it, run it, and
build your own strategy from the parts that are useful to you.

## Layout

```
agent.py                 entry point: the stdin/stdout loop, one message type per branch
agent_core/
  protocol.py             transport: read one JSON object per line, write one back
  state.py                 SurveyState: catalogue + everything tracked across decisions
  geometry.py              public sky maths: sidereal time, alt/az, the 16-fibre grid
  scoring.py               factor/score estimates from PUBLIC scoring config only
  planner.py               decision logic: wait / observe / report / finish
  llm_client.py            an OpenAI-compatible chat client, defaults to Kimi Coding Plan
  clock.py                 the fair-clock budget: remaining CPU, own CPU cost per decision
  memory.py                an optional, best-effort JSONL decision trace (off by default)
  validation.py            protocol-legal action checking + a deterministic fallback
observer.project.json      the platform's project manifest (image, run command, env)
requirements.txt           none needed -- standard library only
.env.example               copy to .env and set an API key before running
pack_agent.py              zip this folder into a project ZIP for submission
```

## Why these modules

- **protocol.py** -- isolates the wire format (JSON-per-line, stdout-only-for-protocol,
  stderr-only-for-logs) so nothing else in the project has to think about it.
- **state.py** -- the single source of truth for what the agent currently knows: the
  target catalogue from `initialize` (as parallel arrays, one slot per target), a
  declination-band spatial index for fast "what's near this point" queries, per-target
  `factor`/`misses`/`attempts`, a learned sky `scale` (the median of recent quality
  samples backed out of the agent's own hits -- the hidden instrument/transparency/sky/
  seeing terms are never read from a file), weather notices, and fault-diagnosis
  history. Built once, updated on every `decision_request`. Also keeps a per-observe-
  action ledger of exact factors, so a Hard-mode `state_resync` can be answered exactly
  -- by dropping the invalidated action-index window from the ledger and recomputing
  each target's best factor from what is left -- instead of only from the resync
  message's `best_scores` (see the comment on `_resync`).
- **geometry.py** -- the public sidereal-time / alt-az / fibre-grid / lunar-factor
  formulas from the participant guide's Geometry and Scoring sections. Any agent
  needs these; they involve no scenario data.
- **scoring.py** -- the *public* parts of `initialize.payload.scoring` (`q0`,
  `flux_zero_point`, `exposure_zero_point_seconds`, `airmass_exponent`, `lunar_model`,
  `program.{bands,multipliers,mismatch_multiplier}`, `required.*`, `uniformity.*`) turned
  into factor/band/multiplier estimates.
- **planner.py** -- an anchor-search strategy: rank visible not-yet-done targets (a
  required target not yet past the public factor threshold gets a large bonus; targets
  setting soon or with few nights left rank higher); for the best few candidates, try
  every fibre as the pointing centre and fill the rest with the best-value neighbours
  that land on the glass; keep the best pointing; pick the exposure length with the best
  expected score per second and the program most assignments will match. Sleeps through
  the day, closes the shutter on an all-sky rain/storm bulletin, and reports a suspected
  instrument fault only after a sustained, unexplained quality drop confirmed over
  several nights. Time-limited observation requests (`active_requests`) get a read-only
  tie-break in the exposure-length search: among durations within a small tolerance of
  the best score-per-second rate, one that also clears a still-needed target's
  `completion_factor_threshold` wins -- it never redirects the pointing itself or chases
  a target that is not already going to be exposed anyway (there is no penalty for
  letting a request expire, so this is opportunistic, not a hunt).
- **llm_client.py** -- an OpenAI-compatible client (plain `urllib`, no SDK) defaulting
  to the Kimi Coding Plan endpoint, configurable to any other OpenAI-compatible
  `/chat/completions` endpoint by environment variable.
- **memory.py** -- an optional, best-effort JSONL decision trace (night advice, the
  finish summary), off by default. The state/planner's own working memory (learned
  scale, per-target progress, night advice, report cooldowns) lives on
  `SurveyState`/`Planner` themselves, since that is genuinely part of what they track.
- **validation.py** -- the last line of defense before anything reaches stdout: checks
  every field the protocol actually validates (ranges, duplicate fibres/targets, unknown
  fields, the consecutive-report limit) and provides `fallback_action()`, a response
  that is always legal no matter what state the agent is in.

## Where the LLM is used

Once at the start of every night (`Planner._night_advice`), two questions go to the
model, each through `LLMClient.ask_json`, each answered as
`{avoid_directions, duration_scale}`:

1. **Forecast call** -- reads tonight's forecast notices plus the current bulletin, and
   asks for directions to avoid and an exposure-length scale.
2. **Bulletin + hit-rate call** -- reads tonight's live bulletin as plain text, plus the
   agent's own hit rate so far this run, and asks the same question from that angle.

The two answers are merged: directions to avoid are unioned, and the duration scale is
averaged. If a call keeps failing after its retries, that question's answer is left out
of the merge for the night (the other one still counts if it succeeded); the next
night's calls are unaffected. Target selection, fibre filling, exposure sizing, and
instrument-fault reporting are otherwise fully deterministic -- calling a model on every
one of the ~1,000-5,000 decisions in a run would waste real time; the
participant guide's own advice is "do not call a model on every decision." A third,
occasional call asks the model to confirm a suspected instrument fault before reporting
one (at most twice per run; the rule-based evidence check that triggers it runs far less
often than once per night).

### Call behaviour

`LLMClient` enforces, regardless of what the model does:

- a per-attempt timeout (default 20 s) and at most 60 s per question, retries included;
- no new call in the last 5 minutes before the real-time cap (see "Time budget" below);
- a call cap per run (default 100 requests);
- up to 4 attempts for one question: HTTP 429/5xx, timeouts and network errors are retried
  with exponential backoff plus jitter, honouring `Retry-After`; other errors (bad key, bad
  request) are not retried. The next scheduled call still goes ahead as normal;
- every exception (network, timeout, bad JSON, missing fields) is caught -- a failed
  attempt never raises past `ask_json`, and `ask_json` returns `None` when all attempts
  for that question are exhausted;
- the HTTP `User-Agent` header is never set or overridden.

## Time budget (fair clock)

Each card has a budget of 900 **normalized CPU seconds**: only the CPU time this program uses
during its own turns is charged, divided by the machine's `speed_factor`. Waiting (model API,
network, idle) and the engine's time are free; a 30-minute real-time cap ends hung runs. Every
`decision_request` carries `payload.wallclock`; the fields this agent uses (`agent_core/clock.py`):

- `remaining_real_cpu_seconds` -- the budget left, in real CPU seconds of *this* machine;
- `wall_remaining_seconds` -- real time left before the 30-minute cap;
- `remaining_seconds` -- the budget left in normalized seconds (fallback for older local runners).

The agent measures its own cost per decision with process CPU time (`time.process_time()`) and compares it
with `remaining_real_cpu_seconds` -- the same unit. Do not time yourself with a wall clock against
`remaining_seconds`: on the platform's measurements such agents lost about 11% on a 2x slower
machine, against about 3.6% when pacing this way. When the budget per remaining decision gets
short, the planner searches less. As a sanity guard it never plans to use more than 80% of the
real time left, since a slow machine could otherwise fill the 30-minute cap with CPU alone.

Model calls only wait, so they cost real time, not budget. They are bounded by real time instead:
a timeout per attempt (20 s), 60 s per question including retries, no new call in the last
5 minutes before the cap, and at most 100 requests per run. HTTP 429 and 5xx, timeouts and network
errors are retried with exponential backoff plus random jitter, honouring `Retry-After`. In the
hidden final a card's 3 repeats run at the same time on your team's key, so rate limits are
likely; when a question still fails, that step uses the rule-based answer.

stdout carries protocol messages only; every log line goes to stderr.

## Configuration (.env)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set an API key before running locally:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

That alone is enough: the client defaults to the
[Kimi Coding Plan](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/) endpoint
`https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1` with model `k3`. Accounts outside mainland China
should instead use `https://api.kimi.ai/coding/v1`:

```
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.kimi.ai/coding/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

`OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_MODEL` override the defaults, so any other
OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint works too (OpenAI itself, a local proxy,
etc.) -- just point them there. `KIMI_API_KEY` is accepted as an alternate name for the
key if you'd rather set that. `.env` is never packed into the ZIP.

`OBSERVER_MODEL_DISABLED=1` (set by the platform for an evaluation started with “This evaluation without a model” / `survey26 eval start --no-model`): the agent needs no key and runs on its rules only, so you can compare with and without an LLM.

Without an API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY` or `KIMI_API_KEY`) configured, the process checks
at startup, before reading anything from stdin, and exits with a message on stderr and
a non-zero exit code.

## On the platform: keys and network

The platform does not inject a model endpoint. In the **Keys and network** section of
Participate, save the variables this agent reads (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, and if needed
`OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_MODEL`). During evaluation these variables are the program's
environment, and the program can reach any public address over HTTPS (port 443) and HTTP
(port 80); other ports, private and internal addresses and cloud metadata addresses are
unreachable. `.env` is never read and never packed into the ZIP. The platform also sets
`HTTPS_PROXY`: HTTP clients that honour it use it automatically, and clients that ignore it can
connect by host name directly. Every address the program connects to is recorded (host, port,
connection count, bytes, first and last time; never content) in your run log and result files.

Several providers, protocols and models can be used at the same time: save one key per provider.
Model calls are paid for by your team.

For example, two calls in parallel through the official `openai` and `anthropic` Python SDKs:

```python
import asyncio, os
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from anthropic import AsyncAnthropic

# One key saved as KIMI_API_KEY under Keys and network.
openai_style = AsyncOpenAI(base_url="https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1", api_key=os.environ["KIMI_API_KEY"])
anthropic_style = AsyncAnthropic(base_url="https://api.kimi.com/coding", api_key=os.environ["KIMI_API_KEY"])

async def ask_both(question: str):
    fast, careful = await asyncio.gather(
        openai_style.chat.completions.create(
            model="kimi-for-coding", max_tokens=256, messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}]),
        anthropic_style.messages.create(
            model="k3", max_tokens=1024, messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}]),
    )
    return fast.choices[0].message.content, careful.content[0].text
```

## Running it locally

This project is agent-side only -- it does not ship the simulator/scorer. Test it with
any tool that speaks the protocol on stdin/stdout (a local runner, or the platform
itself), pointing it at this folder's `agent.py`. See `docs/` for the full protocol and
scoring reference.

`agent.py` reads `initialize` / `decision_request` / `finish` on stdin and writes
`decision_response` on stdout; everything else (logs) goes to stderr, matching the
protocol exactly.

## Packaging / submitting

```bash
python3 pack_agent.py --out ../python-agent.zip
```

This zips the project with `observer.project.json` at the root
(`"protocol": "jsonl-v4"`, `run: ["python3", "-u", "agent.py"]`), skipping `.env`,
`__pycache__`, and `run_output/`. Upload the ZIP as a complete project, or push this
folder to a GitHub repository. No third-party packages are required; if you add one,
list it in `requirements.txt` **and** add a matching `build` step to
`observer.project.json` -- dependencies are not installed automatically otherwise.
The system directories are read-only, so install into the project folder, e.g.
`"build": [["pip", "install", "--no-cache-dir", "--target", ".deps", "-r", "requirements.txt"]]`
with `"PYTHONPATH": "/workspace/.deps"` under `"environment"`. The build step has
internet access; the agent run has none except the model API.

## Safety properties

- Never reads any file: all state comes from stdin.
- Every decision is wrapped in `try`/`except` in `agent.py`; a planner bug produces a
  safe `wait`, never a crash or an `agent_error`.
- `validate_action()` strips anything the protocol would reject before it reaches
  stdout.
- A planning call that keeps failing just leaves that question's answer out of the
  merge for the night; the rest of the decision loop (targeting, exposure sizing,
  validation) runs the same either way.
